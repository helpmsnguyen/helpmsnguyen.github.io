                <li id = "throwingThings"><b>Not Throwing Things:</b> According to Ms. Nguyen herself, the biggest annoyance she encounters frequently is students throwing things, especially into trash cans. She says that it's so annoying that every kid "thinks they're Lebron."</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Chewing Gum:</b> Another thing that bother's Ms. Nguyen is people chewing gum. Despite the signs on her walls that state to not chew gum, she still witnesses it. It bothers her very much. Stop chewing gum and ease her stress today!</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Using Headphones:</b> One more thing that really bothers Ms. Nguyen is people who use headphones. She especially dislikes this when they are using them while they are talking. So, to stay on her good side, listen to your music at another time.</li>
